# Assignment-3
Problem 1: Directory Organizer Objective: Create a command-line tool that organizes files in a directory into categorized subfolders. Tasks: Use the fs module to read the contents of a specified directory. Create subfolders for common file types (e.g., "Images", "Documents", "Videos") based on file extensions. Move files into the appropriate subfolders. Use the path module to handle file paths and ensure cross-platform compatibility. Add error handling to check for invalid or non-existent directories using try...catch. 
Problem 2: File Backup System Objective: Build a command-line tool to back up specified files into a backup folder. Tasks: Use the fs module to copy files from a given source folder to a backup folder (backup/). Use the path module to maintain the original directory structure within the backup folder. Add functionality to log the details of the backup operation (e.g., files copied, size, and timestamps) into a backup-log.txt file. Use try...catch to handle errors such as missing files or permission issues. Add an optional feature to compress the backup folder into a .zip file (optional: use an external package like archiver). 
Problem 3: Environment Inspector Objective: Build a utility to inspect and display system environment variables. Tasks: Use the os module to display the current userâ€™s home directory, hostname, and network interfaces. Use the process object to retrieve and display the current environment variables (e.g., process.env). Write a function to save the inspected environment variables into a env-details.json file in a standardized format using the fs module. Use the path module to ensure the JSON file is saved in a consistent directory structure (logs/env-details.json). Add error handling to ensure invalid operations (e.g., trying to write to a restricted directory) are gracefully handled with meaningful messages.
